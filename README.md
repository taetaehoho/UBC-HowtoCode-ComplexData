UBC's How to Code: Complex Data

How to Code: Complex Data Started 7/3/2021 finished 7/16/2021

Review: Course was exponentially harder than Simple data and I struggled through most of it. Final project was extremely difficult and I still haven't fully completed the TA solver. Mutual recursion, abstraction and graphs were very difficult.
